# Capstone Project

## Project Description
* In this project we are going to design a database schema for easier processing and analysis of the US immigration data. As data engineer, we built a etl pipeline that extracts data from different sources, cleans the data and loads the data into respective tables for easier querying and analysing the data that impact the behaviour of the immigrants in US

The project follows the follow steps:

* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data
* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data
* Step 3: Define the Data Model
* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data
* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up
